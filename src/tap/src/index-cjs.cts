 * CJS default export cannot co-exist with exported types, we have to make
 * the types available as a global namespace. Which, isn't exactly the most
 * elegant thing in the world, since it can conflict with any other module
 * that defines a `tap` global namespace, but at least it's common enough
 * that it doesn't read as too strange or unintuitive.

// This is all to prevent the need for `const t = require('tap').default`,
// which just offends me esthetically.

// The unfortunate side effect of this hybrid approach with a default
// export is that TS does not provide a way to export both types AND
